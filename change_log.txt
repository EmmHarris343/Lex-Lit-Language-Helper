June 29th:
- split up functions to make code cleaner
- added function that will save the json file
- changed around a few variable names to make more clear
- seeing how each sentence could be broken into it's own subfunction. Want to think about ways this could be done threaded, maybe clustered (mostly for fun)




June 28th:
change how generally functioned:
- instead of printing everything, saves the words into list
- instead of only using 1 word and no details. Assigns multiple words to a single sentence, giving extra details of those words
- Added a hacked together percentage counter that prints to console
- added counter for how long each function takes (The small ones can likely be removed becaues they are so quick)
- could easily be changed to save output to a json file

July 13:
Huge changes:
- structure change. Rearranged how everything Rearranged
- added keyword search function
- renamed functions how they were called and what they did
- built classes to help break out what each part it
- did reduce a lot of status logging. but likely isn't really needed.
- began process of having CLI / how it would call / do things
- built a single endpoint for configurations in app_conf / the class Configuration - Has potential to also load it's configuration from config files (like json)
- still might like to build a basic UI. Make it easier to visualize / show data.
- setup venv setup, default launch options.
