## What this does
This app can either: Use a lexicon of high frequency words in a language, or can use a keyword to find example sentences with those words.

This uses lexicons / datasets from: http://www.lexique.org/ (Not included):  
***Has word frequency, noun, verb, gender and a lot of neat and useful information***
    

Uses datasets from: https://tatoeba.org/en (Not included):  
***Provides a list of sentences to see how words might actually be used.***

### üõ†Ô∏è Howto Use (Ish):  
- [x] Download a sentence set from https://tatoeba.org/en
- [x] Download the word list from http://www.lexique.org/
- [x] Rename file names, or adjust setting (see app_conf)
- [x] Adjustable settings, word frequency, and a lot more (see app_conf)
- [x] run `python3 app.py` | use VS code debugger

#### üèÜ GOAL:  
- To help somewhat with the language learning process, specifically word acquisition.
- Provide a search by keyword, or frequency in a language. 
- Provide easy to read sentences with example of words.

#### Would-be-nice:
- More usibility, better search, easier to navigate.
- Increase scope, better features, user profiles.
- Speed improvements. Maybe move away from CLI.

#### üí£ To note üí£
- Purely side project, not fully functional, has bugs.
- More proof of concept in it's current state.
- Not tested on Windows.
