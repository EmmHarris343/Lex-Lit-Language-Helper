## üóØÔ∏è TL;DR
Take common words found in books / films. To provide example sentences with those words used.

## Longer Version:
This app can either: Use a lexicon of high frequency words in a language, to find example sentences with those words. 

Or, it can be used to find a keyword, then find an example sentence with the word used.

This uses lexicons / datasets from: http://www.lexique.org/ (Not included):
- Has a rating system of the most used or common words.
- Can provide extra data for noun, verb, gender, and other.

Uses datasets from: https://tatoeba.org/en (Not included):
- Provide list of sentences (Commonly used in books, movies, series)
- Can use list of sentences to provide example word use cases.


### üõ†Ô∏è Howto Use (Ish):
 - [X] Download a sentence set from https://tatoeba.org/en
 - [X] Download the word list from http://www.lexique.org/
 - [X] Rename file names, or adjust setting (see app_conf)
 - [X] Adjustable settings, word frequency, and a lot more (see app_conf)
 - [X] run `python3 app.py` | use VS code debugger

#### üèÜ GOAL:
- To help somewhat with the language learning process, specifically word acquisition.
- Provide a search by use frequency in a language. 
- Provide easy to read sentences with example of words
- Allow for basic word serach
- Hope to add more advanced search, to find different conjugated versions of words.

#### Would-be-nice:
- More usibility, better search, easier to navigate.
- Speed improvements.
- Increased scope. Add user profiles, track which words user remembers, or others that need more practice.
- Maybe move away from CLI *That may never happen.

#### üí£ To note üí£
- Purely side project, not fully functional, has bugs.
- More proof on concept in it's current state.
- Not tested on Windows.
